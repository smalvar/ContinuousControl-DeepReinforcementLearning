# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree - Project 2: Continuous Control

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Starting
0. Clone this repo.

1. Setup the python enviroment following next link: ![udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies)

2. Copy the content of the `p2_continuous-control/` folder from this repo to the `p2_continuous-control/` folder of the udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning repo and replaces or remove existing files.

3. Unzip the Reacher_Linux.zip file that is located under the `p2_continuous-control/` folder under the same directory. If you are not using Linux, follow the instructions on the botton of this file.


### Instructions

Open a jupyter notebook and open the Continuous_Control.ipynb to train or test the agent.

1. For training from zero run all the cells inside the navigation notebook

2. For testing skip the training section and follow the instructions to load the weights. 

## Dependencies

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```
	
2. Follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/openai/gym) to perform a minimal install of OpenAI gym.  
	- Next, install the **classic control** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#classic-control).
	- Then, install the **box2d** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#box2d).
	
3. Clone the repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python
pip install .
```

4. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.  
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
```

5. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `drlnd` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu.
